# MPP Data Analysis Portfolio

This repository showcases selected coursework and applied data analysis projects from my Master of Public Policy program at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy.  
Each folder corresponds to a core quantitative course emphasizing statistical modeling, program evaluation, or machine learning.

The projects demonstrate my ability to:
- Clean, merge, and analyze data in **R** and **Python**
- Conduct hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and causal inference
- Apply simulation, matching, IV, DiD, and event study methods
- Communicate results through reproducible markdown reports and visualizations
