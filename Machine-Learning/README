# Machine Learning

This folder contains applied work from *Machine Learning for Public Policy*, emphasizing supervised learning and model evaluation.

### Included Project
- **PSET2_Discriminant_Analysis.ipynb** — Applies Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis to classification problems; evaluates model performance using cross-validation and confusion matrices.

### Key Skills
- Supervised learning algorithms (LDA, QDA)  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Visualization and interpretation of classifier performance  
- Implemented in Python with `scikit-learn` and `matplotlib`

This notebook demonstrates practical machine learning applications for policy-relevant datasets.
