# Advanced Statistics for Data Analysis I

This folder contains applied exercises from *Advanced Statistics for Data Analysis I*, focusing on simulation, hypothesis testing, and matching-based causal inference.

### Included Projects
- **HW5_Matching.pdf** — Implements matching methods to estimate treatment effects, comparing covariate balance and outcome differences.  
- **HW6_Simulation.pdf** — Conducts Monte Carlo simulations to assess sampling distributions, hypothesis tests, and the normal approximation for different sample sizes.

### Key Skills
- Simulation and bootstrapping  
- Matching and treatment effect estimation  
- Hypothesis testing and confidence intervals  
- Data visualization with `ggplot2`  

All work completed in R using the `tidyverse`, `estimatr`, and `fixest` packages.
