# Advanced Program Evaluation

This folder contains policy evaluation assignments applying quasi-experimental methods to assess program impacts.

### Included Projects
- **PS3_DID_Event_Study.pdf** — Implements Difference-in-Differences and event study models to estimate treatment effects over time, including visualization of pre-trends and dynamic impacts.  
- **PS4_Multiple_Hypothesis_Testing.pdf** — Applies Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochberg corrections to evaluate multiple hypothesis tests in risk assessment data.

### Key Skills
- Difference-in-Differences (DiD)  
- Event study visualization and interpretation  
- Multiple hypothesis testing corrections  
- Data cleaning and merging administrative datasets  

Analysis performed in R using `fixest`, `did`, and `modelsummary`.
# Machine Learning

This folder contains applied work from *Machine Learning for Public Policy*, emphasizing supervised learning and model evaluation.

### Included Project
- **PSET2_Discriminant_Analysis.ipynb** — Applies Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis to classification problems; evaluates model performance using cross-validation and confusion matrices.

### Key Skills
- Supervised learning algorithms (LDA, QDA)  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Visualization and interpretation of classifier performance  
- Implemented in Python with `scikit-learn` and `matplotlib`

This notebook demonstrates practical machine learning applications for policy-relevant datasets.
