# Advanced Statistics for Data Analysis II

This folder contains applied econometric exercises from *Advanced Statistics for Data Analysis II*, emphasizing binary response models and instrumental variable techniques.

### Included Projects
- **HW6_Binary_DVs.pdf** — Estimates linear probability, probit, and logit models for labor force participation, interpreting marginal effects.  
- **HW7_Instrumental_Variables.pdf** — Uses 2SLS regression to estimate the causal impact of class size on test scores using Maimonides’ rule as an instrument.

### Key Skills
- Binary choice models (LPM, probit, logit)  
- Instrumental variable estimation and first-stage diagnostics  
- Model interpretation and marginal effects  
- Causal identification in cross-sectional data  

All analysis conducted in R using `estimatr`, `AER`, and `tidyverse`.
# Machine Learning

This folder contains applied work from *Machine Learning for Public Policy*, emphasizing supervised learning and model evaluation.

### Included Project
- **PSET2_Discriminant_Analysis.ipynb** — Applies Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis to classification problems; evaluates model performance using cross-validation and confusion matrices.

### Key Skills
- Supervised learning algorithms (LDA, QDA)  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Visualization and interpretation of classifier performance  
- Implemented in Python with `scikit-learn` and `matplotlib`

This notebook demonstrates practical machine learning applications for policy-relevant datasets.
